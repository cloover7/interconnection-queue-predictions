    "**Number of prediction questions:**  The number of prediction questions must be greater than or equal to $N_s-1$, the number of students in the team minus one.  (Two prediction questions are different if they use different target variables.) For example, a 3 person team would need to examine $3-1 = 2$ questions.  Questions should be related, but have distinct work efforts, interpretation and analysis. An example: for land use regression, you could have a core prediction question (what is pollution concentration on a fine spatial scale), a supporting question that explore how the degree of spatial aggregation influences prediction quality, plus a prediction model that explores *temporal* prediction at one point in space.  There is a lot of flexibility here; if you have any doubt about whether your questions are distinct, consult with the instructors.\n",

    "For each Section or Category, we will give points according to the following percentage scale:\n",
    "1. More than 90%:  work that is free of anything but superficial mistakes, and demonstrates creativity and / or a very deep understanding of what you are doing.\n",
    "2. 80-90%: work without fundamental errors and demonstrates a basic understanding of what you're doing.\n",
    "3. 60-80%: work with fundamental flaws in the analysis and / or conveys that you do not understand the basics of the work you are trying to do.\n",
    "4. Below 60%: Work that is severely lacking or incomplete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we distinguish *mistakes* from *\"my idea didn't work\"*.  Sometimes you don't know if you can actually do the thing you're trying to do and as you dig in you find that you can't.  That doesn't necessarily mean you made a mistake; it might just mean you needed more information.  We'll still give high marks to ambitious projects that \"fail\" at their stated objective, as long as that objective was clear and you demonstrate an understanding of what you were doing and why it didn't work.\n",

Make time to take a step back from the individual parts of the notebook to think about how it flows as a complete document.\n",

    "* We won’t read your code cells to understand your thinking or methods\n",
    "* We will only use your code cells to verify your workflow\n",
    "* Less is more when it comes to code output and visualizations. Any output should serve a purpose for the reader of the notebook, and you should make that purpose clear in your markdown cells.  For example: \n",
    "* Don’t display every line of a dataframe; use `.head()` or printouts of specific parts of a dataframe judiciously. Display contents of a dataframe when you want to show the reader something specific, and explain your thinking in a markdown cell.\n",
    "* Use visualizations to tell your story, but make sure you explain in markdown cells what’s important about your visualizations. If you can’t tell the reader what’s important about the visualization, leave it out!\n",
    "* Suppress output of functions unless it is crucial to explain your thinking and demonstrate your workflow.\n",
    "* Generally, the notebook should not contain copious amounts of data, function outputs, plots. Think of your notebook as a giant function with a `verbose` argument…I want verbose = FALSE.\n"

    "The Interconnection Queue is a waitlist of proposed electricity generation projects, ranging from solar to gas to coal, that are seeking to connect to the electric grid. Once on the queue, the project has to undergo a series of reviews before they can become operational. However, the queue is greatly backlogged, causing many projects to wait years because they can even enter the review process, let alone become operational. Thus, the queue has become a bottleneck, reducing the possible addition of much new generation capacity to the grid. In recent years, there have been reforms put in place, such as those from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 2023, which sought to streamline the interconnection queue process. One such reform addresses interconnection queue backlog through a \"first-ready, first-served\" cluster study process, which allowed interconnection requests that are equally queued and of equal study priority to be studied in groups. Increased financial commitments and readiness requirements to enter and proceed in the queue were put in place as well. Only time will tell whether or not the reforms prove successful in reducing the backlog and making the process more efficient. In the meantime, there is a need for quantitative analysis that would be helpful both for projects currently in the queue and those that are considering entering it. This includes creating models that predict the likelihood a project will get accepted within 5 years and what their POI cost per kilowatt would be. These types of quantitative analyses will help projects determine whether they should stay or withdraw, or even join the queue in the first place, based on information regarding potential wait time on the queue and POI cost if accepted. As a result, the system will also become more efficient as projects that end up withdrawing later on in the queue process will not be there to contribute to the long wait times or trigger the consequences of withdrawal, such as a need for restudies and reevaluation of cost allocations in cluster studies.

    "In this section you will pose the central objective or objectives for your semester project.  Objectives should be extremely clear, well-defined and clearly cast as forecasting problems.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Comment on novelty:** You may find it hard to identify a project question that has *never* been answered before.  It's ok if you take inspiration from existing analyses.  However you shouldn't exactly reproduce someone else's analysis.  If you take inspiration from another analyses, you should still use different models, different data, and so on.\n",

    "The purpose of this project is to train and evaluate different models to predict the likelihood a project on the interconnection queue will be accepted within 5 years, using a variety of features drawn from LBNL and CEC datasets that have been cleaned to include only CAISO proejcts. \n",
    "Another objective of this project is to train and evaluate different models to predict the POI cost per kilowatt for a project on the interconnection queue, using a variety of features drawn from a LBNL dataset that focuses on projects with non-ISO entities. \n",
    "It is important to answer these questions in an effort to streamline the interconnection queue process. Many projects withdraw due to long queue times and high costs, and our prediction models will be able to provide projects an estimate of whether or not they will be accepted with 5 years as well as what their POI cost per kilowatt will be. This allows projects to make a decision early on regarding whether or not they want to join, or stay in, the queue. A direct consequene of this will be a more efficient interconnection queue, and resources will be allocated to projects that have already determined they are willing to wait in the queue and pay the cost required to connect to the electric grid.

    "2. Motivate all your modeling decisions.  This includes parameter choices (e.g., how many folds in k-fold cross validation, what time window you use for averaging your data) as well as model form (e.g., If you use regression trees, why?  If you include nonlinear features in a regression model, why?). \n",
    "1. Carefully describe your cross validation and model selection process.  You should partition your data into training and testing data sets.  The training data set is what you use for cross-validation (i.e. you sample from within it to create folds, etc.).  The testing data set is held to the very end of your efforts, and used to compare qualitatively different models (e.g. OLS vs random forests).\n",

How might they allocate their resources differently with the results of your model?  Why should the reader care about your results?  *To get full marks you must provide both a qualitative and quantitative analysis.*\n",
    "2. Discuss caveats and / or reasons your results might be flawed.  No model is perfect, and understanding a model's imperfections is extremely important for the purpose of knowing how to interpret your results.  Often, we know the model output is wrong but we can assign a direction for its bias.  This helps to understand whether or not your answers are conservative.  \n",
